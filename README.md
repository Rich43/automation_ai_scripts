# Automation AI Scripts

Collection of experimental automation utilities and demos.

This repository began as **automation-scripts**, a small prototype for
desktop automation. Another AI agent expanded the project into a more
comprehensive solution called **AutomationToolkit**, which now lives in its
own directory alongside the original scripts.
