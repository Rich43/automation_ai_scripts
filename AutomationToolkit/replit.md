# Progressive Desktop Automation Challenge System

## Overview

This is a sophisticated AI-driven desktop automation system that uses computer vision and progressive challenges to automate complex workflows. The system starts with basic system detection and progressively advances through software installation, application launching, UI navigation, and complex task execution in applications like KiCad.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Business Goals: Interested in commercializing the desktop automation system, planning to learn business skills through Y Combinator's Startup School.
Founder Profile: Technical founder (Wozniak/George Hotz-type) - brilliant at technology but finds business aspects intimidating. Direct communication style, can be crude like comma.ai's founder. Needs business partner or support to handle non-technical aspects.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture

## Data Flow

### 1. Challenge Execution Flow
```
User Initiates Challenge → Challenge Manager → Automation Engine → AI Vision → Desktop Interaction → Result Feedback
```

### 2. Vision Analysis Flow
```
Screenshot Capture → Base64 Encoding → OpenAI GPT-4o → JSON Response → Coordinate Extraction → Action Execution
```

### 3. Real-time Updates Flow
```
Challenge Events → Event Queue → Web Interface → Frontend Updates → User Dashboard
```
