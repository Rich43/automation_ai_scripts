# Unit Testing Plan

This document outlines how to expand test coverage for the repository.

## Objectives

- Ensure critical modules under `AutomationToolkit/` are tested.
- Achieve at least 90% code coverage for new modules.
- Use `pytest` with fixtures and mocking where appropriate.

## Proposed Test Areas

1. **Logger Configuration (`AutomationToolkit/logger_config.py`)**
   - Verify that loggers are created with the correct level and handlers.
   - Test formatting of log messages.

2. **Utilities (`AutomationToolkit/utils.py`)**
   - Cover edge cases for helper functions such as `run_command`,
     `get_system_info`, and decorators like `retry_with_backoff`.
   - Include exception handling paths to ensure failures are logged properly.

3. **Automation Engine (`AutomationToolkit/automation_engine.py`)
   - Mock external dependencies to test workflow logic without side effects.
   - Validate task sequencing and error propagation.

4. **Web Interface (`AutomationToolkit/web_interface.py`)
   - Use Flask test client to exercise routes and expected responses.

## Test Organization

- Mirror the source layout within the `tests/` folder.
- Use descriptive test names and parametrization for boundary cases.
- Provide fixtures for reusable setups such as temporary directories or
  environment variables.

## Running Tests

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage xml
```

The above commands generate an XML report for CI analysis.
