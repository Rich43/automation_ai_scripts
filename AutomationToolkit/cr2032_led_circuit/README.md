# Cr2032 Led Circuit

## Circuit Description
Simple LED circuit powered by CR2032 battery with push button switch.

## Components:
- BT1: CR2032 3V Lithium Battery
- SW1: Momentary Push Button Switch  
- D1: LED (any color)
- R1: 330Ω Current Limiting Resistor

## Circuit Operation:
When the push button (SW1) is pressed, current flows from the positive terminal of the CR2032 battery (BT1) through the 330Ω resistor (R1), through the LED (D1), and back to the negative terminal of the battery, completing the circuit and lighting the LED.
