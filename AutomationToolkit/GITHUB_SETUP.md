# How to Upload This Code to Your GitHub Repository

## Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

### Step 1: Download All Files
Right-click on each file in the Replit file browser and "Download" these key files:
- `app.py` (main server)
- `automation_engine.py` (core automation)
- `vision_analyzer.py` (AI vision system)
- `challenge_manager.py` (challenge orchestrator)
- `kicad_circuit_generator.py` (circuit generator)
- `demo_kicad_automation.py` (demonstration script)
- `config.py` (configuration)
- `logger_config.py` (logging setup)
- `utils.py` (utilities)
- `system_detector.py` (system detection)
- `software_installer.py` (software installation)
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (setup instructions)
- `setup_requirements.txt` (Python packages)
- `replit.md` (project documentation)
- `challenges/` folder (all challenge files)
- `templates/` folder (web interface)
- `static/` folder (CSS/JS files)
- `cr2032_led_circuit/` folder (example circuit)

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `progressive-desktop-automation`
4. Make it public
5. Don't initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Upload Files
1. Click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all the downloaded files
3. Write commit message: "Initial commit - Progressive Desktop Automation System"
4. Click "Commit changes"

## Option 2: Command Line Git (Advanced)

If you have git installed on your PC:

```bash
# Clone this Replit to your PC
git clone https://github.com/replit/your-replit-name
cd your-replit-name

# Create your GitHub repo first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/progressive-desktop-automation.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Download as ZIP

1. In Replit, click the three dots menu
2. Select "Download as ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file on your PC
4. Upload the extracted files to your GitHub repository
